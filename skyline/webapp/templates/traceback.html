Skyline has errored... it would be nice to say it was sorry, but it is just
code on a machine and has no sentiment towards this event whatsoever.

  <h4><span class="logo"><span class="sky">Skyline ::</span> <span class="re">advice ::</span></span> please read <strong>very, very carefully</strong></h4>

... there are no breadcrumbs here leading from whence you came<br>
<br>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Record this very, very useful information and <strong>copy and paste into an
  email</strong> addressed to your relevant Skyline authorities requesting them
  to please ask your Skyline administrator/s, to check the Skyline webapp log
  and report an issue <strong>ONLY</strong> if they determine this error
  <code>is not a system related error</code>, but a genuine anomaly in Skyline,
  which is <strong>very doubtful.</strong>  Perhaps you should add the administrator/s
  email addresses too in the cc field, but ensure that their manager or boss'
  email is the <code>to:</code> address</li>
  <li>Perhaps also ask them if they have tried turning the machine called
  <code>{{ bad_machine }}</code> off and on again as that often works.</li>
  <li>Then please feel free to click the back button in your browser.  However, if you
  are viewing this page with a <strong>mobile device</strong>, then please consult the device's manual
  and find it's equivalent to the browser back button.</li>
  <li>If you have really exhausted <strong>ALL</strong> options and your Skyline
  administrator/s have spent an acceptable amount of <code>hours</code> trying
  to fix your Skyline, then see the
  <span class="logo"><span class="sky">Skyline ::</span> <span class="re">bug reporting and issues</span></span>
  section below.
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
So just to recap on the <strong>most likely causes</strong> (in order of
likelihood):<br>
<br>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The machine called <code>{{ bad_machine }}</code> has problems and cannot
  be expected to do this important task anymore (speak to administrator/s)</li>
  <li>Your administrator/s need to try and improve their skills (speak to administrator/s and
  their managers and make then aware of this need for skills improvement)</li>
  <li>You did something stupid.  Unfortunately it is hard to give specific
  advice on this, however you could try speaking to family and friends about
  this personal issue.</li>
  <li>It is a genuine Skyline error (very unlikely as it may be) see the
  <span class="logo"><span class="sky">Skyline ::</span> <span class="re">bug reporting and issues</span></span>
  section below.</li>
</ol>

  <h4><span class="logo"><span class="sky">Skyline ::</span> <span class="re">apologises ::</span></span> a sorry and some compensation</h4>

Although the Skyline code and machine called <code>{{ bad_machine }}</code> may
have no sentiment to this event, just fact that it has ocurred
will be <code>troubling</code> for <strong>most</strong> people.  Although do
<strong>rest assured</strong> that this is probably not a problem with Skyline,
it is most likely due to the reasons highlighted above (see
<span class="logo"><span class="sky">Skyline ::</span> <span class="re">advice</span></span></span>
above).<br>
<br>
So by way of apology, please consider the works of David Thorne on
<a href="https://www.27bslash6.com/" target="_blank">27B/6</a> as a form of
compensation for this inconvience you must surely be feeling at this moment.<br>

If you are unfamiliar with David's works, a recommended starting place would be:<br>

  <h4>Overdue account - <a href="https://27bslash6.com/overdue.html" target="_blank">https://27bslash6.com/overdue.html</a></h4>

Please note all links to 27B/6 leave this page and open in a new browser tab.</br>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Warning!</strong> The status of this "open in a new browser tab"
feature on mobile devices is <strong>unknown</strong>.  Please consult your device's manual to
determine what the equivalent of a new browser tab is on your device.  Perhaps
you should also consider not trying to be this clever on your phone.  There is a
reason it is called "a phone".  Given the uncertainty surrounding the state of
new tabs on your device, instead of partaking in the wistful delights of 27B/6,
perhaps you should phone a friend instead.  Seeing as you are on a phone right
now, it may be more appropriate.  Also it will be helpful in solving the
dilemma with which you are now faced with, how do you carry out the
extremely ardous task of following the instructions that are laid out above
in the <span class="logo"><span class="sky">Skyline ::</span> <span class="re">advice</span></span>
section on a phone?
  </div>


Please ensure that you know the URL / address of your Skyline server that gets
you to this page before you leave, perhaps write it down just to be sure.<br>

  <h4><span class="logo"><span class="sky">Skyline ::</span> <span class="re">bug reporting and issues ::</span></span></span> <a href="https://github.com/earthgecko/skyline/issues" target="_blank"> on the GitHubs</a></h4>

Should your relevant Skyline authorities not be able to fix Skyline and turning
<code>{{ bad_machine }}</code> off and on again did not fix the problem and
there are no related issues to this problem you are experiencing, you could try
reading the documentation and seeing if that helps any.<br>

Although it probably will not as the documentation does not have any pages or
sections on fixing errors, but you would possibility get a better understanding
of Skyline and it would be nice to know that people are reading it.</br>
