1.2.12
======

v1.2.12 - April 3, 2019

New functionality
-----------------

- Adds the new Ionosphere echo functionality related to improving the matching
  of Mirage based features profiles by between 30-50% depending on the metric.
  See https://earthgecko-skyline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ionosphere_echo.html

Fixes
-----

- Adds the ability for Skyline Boundary to handle very short time series.
- Updated tsfresh-0.4.0.py2.data.json.features.transposed.csv with new longer
  decimal values introduced by numpy==1.15.1 pandas==0.24.3

Changes from v1.2.11
--------------------

- Allow Boundary to analyse short time series (#88, #2862)
- Bifurcate dependencies for py3 testing (#2588, #2828)
- Added functionality and changes to implement Ionosphere echo (#2484)
- Updated tsfresh-0.4.0.py2.data.json.features.transposed.csv with new longer
  decimal values introduced by numpy==1.15.1 pandas==0.24.3 (2902)

Update notes
------------

- You can only upgrade to v1.2.12 from v1.2.11
- There are changes to the DB
- There are some changes to settings.py

How to update from v1.2.11
--------------------------

- Download the new release tag or clone/update to get it to a temp location,
  ready to be deployed.
- Diff your current running version skyline/settings.py with the new version of
  skyline/settings.py and create a new settings.py in the temp location
  appropriate for Skyline v1.2.12 and your set up with the new IONOSPHERE_ECHO
  settings, ready to be deployed.  New settings to be added are:

        metric features profiles.  Ionosphere's matching performance is increased
        between 30 to 50 percent when Ionosphere echo is run.

        for Skyline implematations pre Ionosphere echo (v1.2.12) to prevent timeouts

        metrics with lots of existing features profiles.

- Stop Skyline Ionosphere and Panorama services.
- Backup your Skyline database.
- Apply the SQL update to your Skyline database as per described below, change
  the below variables as appropriate to your set up.
- Stop all the Skyline services and ensure any service controls such as monit,
  supervisor or systemd do not start them again, (change as appropriate for
  your set up)

- Move your current Skyline directory to a backup directory and move the new
  Skyline v1.2.12 with your new settings.py from the temp location to your
  working Skyline directory, (change your paths as appropriate) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH" "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    mv "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH" "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"

- Start the all Skyline services (change as appropriate for your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start all other Skyline services

- Check the logs

    # How are they running
    tail -n 20 /var/log/skyline/*.log

    # Any errors - each app
    find /var/log/skyline -type f -name "*.log" | while read skyline_logfile
