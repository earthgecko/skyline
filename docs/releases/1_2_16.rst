How to update from v1.2.15
--------------------------

- Download the new release tag or clone/update to get it to a temp location,
  ready to be deployed.
- Diff your current running version skyline/settings.py with the new version of
  skyline/settings.py and create a new settings.py in the temp location
  appropriate for Skyline v1.2.16 and your instance with the new
  :mod:`settings.SLACK_OPTS` dictionary options, ready to be deployed.  The new
  options that have been added to the `SLACK_OPTS` dictionary are shown below.
  Replace the `YOUR_` variables with your channel and channel_id strings.  You
  can set the message_on options for each event type.  If you do not want
  Skyline to update slack threads, set `thread_updates: False`:

.. code-block:: python

      # Your default slack Skyline channel name e.g. '#skyline'
      'default_channel': 'YOUR_default_slack_channel',
      # Your default slack Skyline channel id e.g. 'C0XXXXXX'
      'default_channel_id': 'YOUR_default_slack_channel_id',
      # Whether to update slack message threads on any of the below events
      'thread_updates': True,
      # You can disable or enable each message_on event
      'message_on_training_data_viewed': True,
      'message_on_training_data_viewed_reaction_emoji': 'eyes',
      'message_on_features_profile_created': True,
      'message_on_features_profile_created_reaction_emoji': 'thumbsup',
      'message_on_features_profile_learnt': True,
      'message_on_features_profile_learnt_reaction_emoji': 'heavy_check_mark',
      'message_on_features_profile_disabled': True,
      'message_on_features_profile_disabled_reaction_emoji': 'x',
      'message_on_validated_features_profiles': True,


- Stop Skyline Ionosphere and Panorama services.
- Backup your Skyline database.
- Apply the SQL update to your Skyline database as per described below, change
  the below variables as appropriate to your set up.
- Stop all the Skyline services and ensure any service controls such as monit,
  supervisor or systemd do not start them again, (change as appropriate for
  your set up)

.. code-block:: bash

    NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.16"    # Your new Skyline version
    OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.15"    # Your old Skyline version

    CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH="/opt/skyline/github/skyline"                 # Your Skyline path
    NEW_SKYLINE_PATH="${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"  # Your new Skyline path

    mkdir -p "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    cd "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    git clone https://github.com/earthgecko/skyline .
    git checkout "$NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION"

    cp "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py" "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}.bak"
    cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}/skyline/settings.py" > "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py"

    # ADD the new SLACK_OPTS to settings
    vi "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py"

    # Stop Skyline DB related services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="ionosphere
    luminosity
    panorama"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i stop
    done
    # And stop any service controls like monit or systemd

    # BACKUP THE DB AND APPLY THE NEW SQL
    BACKUP_DIR="/tmp"  # Where you want to backup the DB to
    MYSQL_USER="<YOUR_MYSQL_USER>"
    MYSQL_HOST="127.0.0.1"  # Your MySQL IP
    MYSQL_DB="skyline"  # Your MySQL Skyline DB name

    # Backup DB
    mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
    mysqldump -u$MYSQL_USER -p $MYSQL_DB > $BACKUP_DIR/pre.$NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION.$MYSQL_DB.sql

    # Update DB
    mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p $MYSQL_DB < "${NEW_SKYLINE_PATH}/updates/sql/v1.2.16-stable.sql"

    # Stop all other Skyline services

    done

- Move your current Skyline directory to a backup directory and move the new
  Skyline v1.2.16 with your new settings.py from the temp location to your
  working Skyline directory, (change your paths as appropriate) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH" "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    mv "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH" "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"

- Update the dependencies

.. code-block:: bash

    PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION="2.7"
    PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_DIR="/opt/python_virtualenv"
    # Handle 2.7.14 and 2.7.16
    PROJECT="skyline-py2716"
    if [ ! -d "${PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_DIR}/projects/${PROJECT}" ]; then
      PROJECT="skyline-py2714"
    fi
    cd "${PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_DIR}/projects/${PROJECT}"
    source bin/activate
    # This can take lots of minutes with the new pandas
    bin/"pip${PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION}" install $(cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}/requirements.txt" | grep "^numpy\|^scipy\|^patsy\|^pandas" | tr '\n' ' ')
    # Remove the luminol egg as it will already be installed and pip will moan
    cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}/requirements.txt" | grep -v "luminol" > /tmp/requirements.txt

    # IF YOU ARE ON CENTOS 6 and running mainstream mysql-server-5.1 uncomment
    # the following line and run it to fix to mysql-python-connector 8.0.6
    #cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}/requirements.txt" | grep -v "luminol\|mysql-connector-python" > /tmp/requirements.txt

    bin/"pip${PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION}" install -r /tmp/requirements.txt

- Start the all Skyline services (change as appropriate for your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="panorama
    luminosity
    horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i start
    done

- Check the logs

.. code-block:: bash

    # How are they running
    tail -n 20 /var/log/skyline/*.log

    # Any errors - each app
    find /var/log/skyline -type f -name "*.log" | while read skyline_logfile
    do
      echo "#####
    # Checking for errors in $skyline_logfile"
      cat "$skyline_logfile" | grep -B2 -A10 -i "error ::\|traceback" | tail -n 60
      echo ""
      echo ""
    done
