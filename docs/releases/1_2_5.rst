1.2.5 - the luminosity branch
==============================

v1.2.5-luminosity - August 1x, 2018

Changes from v1.2.4
-------------------

- Bumped to v1.2.5-stable-luminosity
- Display the last 30 data points on the training_data page to inform the
  operator of the Redis graph data points for comparison with any
  Existing :: layers (2482)
- Allow user to specifically set metric as a derivative metric in training_data.
  If a metric has not been analysed in terms of being a strictly monotonic
  metric due to a reset of the metric, allow the operator to set this in the
  training_data page and reload the graphs. (2488)
- Report no matches found if no matches are found, fixes #64, closes #64 (2496)
- Added the functionality for Skyline to send a digest alert on metrics that
  stop sending data, this digest alert will only be sent once for a metric once
  between ALERT_ON_STALE_PERIOD and STALE_PERIOD and a key set with the expiry
  of STALE_PERIOD if the metric has been alerted on. After the STALE_PERIOD has
  passed, the alert evaluation will no longer be done, ensuring that these
  alerts are not noisy  (closes #67) (2492)
- If from=-<x>hours is used as a Graphite render parameter the scale is
  incorrect if x hours > than first retention period, passing the absolute from
  and until parameter renders the graph with the correct scale for the
  resolution (fixes #65 and closes #65) (2498).
- nonNegativeDerivative applied twice in learn.py to existing json data, with
  the introduction of calculating the nonNegativeDerivative in both  Analyzer
  and Mirage before the initial analysis, both apps are now passing the
  preprocessed time series to the send_anomalous_metric_to function. However in
  skyline/ionosphere/learn.py the metric is still being checked to determine if
  it is in derivative_metrics and the nonNegativeDerivative function was being
  applied to the existing json data, if the json data already exists. This was
  incorrect. It is correct in the context of learn.py having to fetch the the
  data from Graphite, however applying nonNegativeDerivative to existing json
  data was incorrect and did not have the desired result (fixes #66 and closes #66)
  (2506)
- Added try and except to prevent some errors that are encounter between 00:14
  and 00:17 on some days (2492) #67
  +        # if int(time()) - int(timeseries[-1][0]) >= ALERT_ON_STALE_PERIOD:
  +        # IndexError: list index out of range
    #68 Ionosphere validate learnt features profiles page
    IssueID #2430: Ionosphere validate learnt features profiles page (#68)
- Added get_features_profiles_to_validate and get_metrics_with_features_profiles_to_validate
  functions to skyline/webapp/ionosphere_backend.py (2430, #68)
- Added validate_features_profiles.html template and added the context to the
  other pages (2430, #68)
- Hard code IONOSPHERE_PROCESSES to 1. This variable is only declared for
  the purpose of maintaining a standard set up in each module and to possibly
  enable more than one processor on Ionosphere in the future, should there be a
  requirement for Ionosphere to analyse the metrics quicker.  Running Ionosphere
  with more than one process is untested and currently it is hard coded to be 1,
  fixes #69 and closes #69 (2526)
- Added docs validate_features_profiles demo page resources (2430, #68)

Update notes
------------

- NOTE: If you are running v1.x you CANNOT upgrade from v1.x directly to v1.2.5
- There is are no SQL changes with this release.
- There are 2 additional variables added to settings.py change:
  :mod:`settings.ALERT_ON_STALE_METRICS`, :mod:`settings.ALERT_ON_STALE_PERIOD`
  and :mod:`settings.DO_NOT_ALERT_ON_STALE_METRICS`
- There are no changes in requirements.txt

How to update from v1.2.2, v1.2.3 or v1.2.4
-------------------------------------------

- Download the new release tag or clone/update to get it to a temp location,
  ready to be deployed.
- Diff your current running version skyline/settings.py with the new version of
  skyline/settings.py and create a new settings.py in the temp location
  appropriate for Skyline v1.2.5 and your set up, ready to be deployed.
- Stop all the Skyline services and ensure any service controls such as monit,
  supervisor or systemd do not start them again, (change as appropriate for
  your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.5-stable-luminosity"    # Your new Skyline version
    OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.4-stable-luminosity"    # Your old Skyline version
    # OR
    # OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.2-stable-luminosity"
    # OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.3-stable-luminosity"

    CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH="/opt/skyline/github/skyline"                 # Your Skyline path
    NEW_SKYLINE_PATH="${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"  # Your new Skyline path

    mkdir -p "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    cd "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    git clone https://github.com/earthgecko/skyline .
    git checkout "$NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION"

    # Stop all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    luminosity
    panorama
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i stop
    done

- Move your current Skyline directory to a backup directory and move the new
  Skyline v1.2.5 with your new settings.py from the temp location to your
  working Skyline directory, (change your paths as appropriate) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv /opt/skyline/github/skyline /opt/skyline/github/skyline.v1.2.4-luminosity-stable
    mv "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH" "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"

- Start the all Skyline services (change as appropriate for your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="panorama
    luminosity
    horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i start
    done
