v1.2.14 - April 15, 2019

This is release includes:

- Dependencies updates
- Code changes for redis-py package update
- mysql-connector-python notes
- Minor bug fixes
- Updates on Python and Redis versions in docs and the test build script

A note on version changes
-------------------------

The documentation has been updated to use Python 2.7.16 and Redis 4.0.14, these
changes do not require any immediate updates of Skyline installations running
Python 2.7.14 or an earlier version of Redis, v1.2.14 will still work on
Python-2.7.14 and Redis 3.x.

Changes in v1.2.14
------------------

- Update dependencies (2926)
- Note requirement of old version of mysql-connector-python if mainstream MySQL
  5.1 is used (2590)
- Updated skyline.conf USE_PYTHON to py2716 (2926)
- Update docs to Python-2.7.16 and redis-4.0.14 (2926)
- Corrected adding the metric list to the self.real_anomalous_metrics list
  instead of just the basename for Mirage periodic checks (2932, 2882)
- calc_value in get_calculated_features sometimes generates an error so wrapped
  in try with logging relating to Ionosphere echo (2484) to determine what value
  is causing:
  `ValueError: could not convert string to float`
- redis-py 3.x only accepts user data as bytes, strings or numbers (ints, longs
  and floats).  All 2.X users should make sure that the keys and values they
  pass into redis-py are either bytes, strings or numbers.  Changed all key
  values that were passed as a list to a str, they are all evaluted upstream
  with literal_eval already (2824, 2926)
- calc_value in get_calculated_features is sometimes empty for
  autocorrelation_lag values so disabled traceback and log as info not error in
  the Ionosphere echo context (2484)
- Updated roadmap doc regarding NAB scoreboard update (1884, 2802)
- Any features profiles that were created before the introduction of (1960)
  ionosphere_layers will not have a mirage.redis.24h.json file as the
  creation of these resources in the training_data dir was only added at
  that point, so they are excluded.  Less than 20170307 1488844800 excl. (2934)
- Only process metric with echo if it is an ionosphere enabled metric (2484)
- Corrected adding the metric list to the self.real_anomalous_metrics list
  instead of just the basename (2932, 2882)

Update notes
------------

- These update instruction apply to upgrading from v1.2.13 to v1.2.14 only.
  However as with all Skyline updates it is possible to go through the update
  notes for each version and make your own update notes/process to take you from
  version x to version y.
- There are no changes to the DB in v1.2.14
- There are no changes to settings.py in v1.2.14

How to update from v1.2.13
--------------------------

- Download the new release tag or clone/update to get it to a temp location,
  ready to be deployed.
- Stop all the Skyline services and ensure any service controls such as monit,
  supervisor or systemd do not start them again, (change as appropriate for
  your set up)

.. code-block:: bash

    NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.14"    # Your new Skyline version
    OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.13"    # Your old Skyline version

    CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH="/opt/skyline/github/skyline"                 # Your Skyline path
    NEW_SKYLINE_PATH="${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"  # Your new Skyline path

    mkdir -p "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    cd "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    git clone https://github.com/earthgecko/skyline .
    git checkout "$NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION"

    cp "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py" "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py.$OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION.bak"
    cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}/skyline/settings.py" > "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py"

- Update the dependencies in you Python virtualenv (this takes a long time).
  The redis-py update is left till the very end otherwise Skyline will start to
  error.
- Update the pip dependencies  PLEASE USE THE APPROPRIATE Python verison for
  your install, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION="2.7"
    PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_DIR="/opt/python_virtualenv"
    # Handle 2.7.14 and 2.7.16
    PROJECT="skyline-py2716"
    if [ ! -d "${PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_DIR}/projects/${PROJECT}" ]; then
      PROJECT="skyline-py2714"
    fi
    cd "${PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_DIR}/projects/${PROJECT}"
    source bin/activate
    # This can take lots of minutes with the new pandas
    bin/"pip${PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION}" install $(cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}/requirements.txt" | grep "^numpy\|^scipy\|^patsy\|^pandas" | tr '\n' ' ')
    # Remove the luminol egg as it will already be installed and pip will moan
    # Remove Redis to be updated last
    cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}/requirements.txt" | grep -v "luminol\|redis" > /tmp/requirements.txt
    bin/"pip${PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION}" install -r /tmp/requirements.txt

    # Stop all other Skyline services and any sevice controls you may have
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    luminosity
    panorama
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i stop
    done

    # Update redis-py
    cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}/requirements.txt" | grep "redis" > /tmp/redis.requirements.txt
    bin/"pip${PYTHON_MAJOR_VERSION}" install -r /tmp/redis.requirements.txt
    deactivate

- Move your current Skyline directory to a backup directory and move the new
  Skyline v1.2.14 with your new settings.py from the temp location to your
  working Skyline directory, (change your paths as appropriate) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH" "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    mv "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH" "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"

- Start the all Skyline services (change as appropriate for your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="panorama
    luminosity
    horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i start
    done

- Check the logs

.. code-block:: bash

    # How are they running
    tail -n 20 /var/log/skyline/*.log

    # Any errors - each app
    find /var/log/skyline -type f -name "*.log" | while read skyline_logfile
    do
      echo "#####
    # Checking for errors in $skyline_logfile"
      cat "$skyline_logfile" | grep -B2 -A10 -i "error ::\|traceback" | tail -n 60
      echo ""
      echo ""
    done
