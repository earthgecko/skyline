.. code-block:: bash

    # Get the new version
    NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION="v3.0.4"    # Your new Skyline version
    OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v3.0.3"    # Your old Skyline version
    # OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v3.0.0"    # Your old Skyline version

    CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH="/opt/skyline/github/skyline"                 # Your Skyline path
    NEW_SKYLINE_PATH="${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"  # Your new Skyline path

    mkdir -p "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    cd "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    git clone https://github.com/earthgecko/skyline .
    git checkout "$NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION"

    # settings.py
    cp "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py" "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}.bak"

    # Create a new settings.py file in the new version based on your existing
    # settings.py file
    cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}/skyline/settings.py" > "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/skyline/settings.py"

    # **TEST**
    # Test your new settings.py BEFORE continuing with the upgrade,
    # test_settings.sh runs the validate_settings.py that the Skyline apps run
    # when they start
    $NEW_SKYLINE_PATH/bin/test_settings.sh

    # Stop/disable any/all service controls like monit, etc that are controlling
    # Skyline services.

    # NOTE ALL SKYLINE SERVICES ARE LISTED HERE, REMOVE TO ONES YOU DO NOT RUN
    # or do not wish to run.

    analyzer_batch

    crucible

    ionosphere

    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      systemctl stop "$i"
    done

- Move your current Skyline directory to a backup directory and move the new
  Skyline v3.0.4 with your new settings.py from the temp location to your
  working Skyline directory, (change your paths as appropriate) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH" "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    mv "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH" "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"

    # Set permission on the dump dir
    chown skyline:skyline "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"/skyline/webapp/static/dump


- Start the all Skyline services (change as appropriate for your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # NOTE ALL SKYLINE SERVICES ARE LISTED HERE, REMOVE TO ONES YOU DO NOT RUN
    # apart from the new thunder Skyline app

    # Start all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="horizon
    flux
    panorama
    webapp
    vista
    analyzer
    analyzer_batch
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    luminosity
    snab
    thunder"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      systemctl start "$i"
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "failed to start $i"
      else
        echo "started $i"
      fi
    done
    # Restart any/all service controls like monit, etc that are controlling
    # Skyline services.

- Check the logs

.. code-block:: bash

    # How are they running
    tail -n 20 /var/log/skyline/*.log

    # Any errors - each app
    find /var/log/skyline -type f -name "*.log" | while read skyline_logfile
    do
      echo "#####
    # Checking for errors in $skyline_logfile"
      cat "$skyline_logfile" | grep -B2 -A10 -i "error ::\|traceback" | tail -n 60
      echo ""
      echo ""
    done

Congratulations, you are now running the best open source anomaly detection
cluster stack in the world (probably).
