<p>Things on the horizon :)</p>
<p>This is not really a roadmap per se it is more just a collection of
ideas at the moment, in no particular order.</p>
<p>UPDATE 20180526 - Skyline itself now seems to write its own roadmap and also
seems to be plotting it’s own course.  Regardless of any whaffle you may read
here.</p>

<h2>Further performance improvements and Python-3.5<a class="headerlink" href="#further-performance-improvements-and-python-3-5" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Further performance improvements where possible with the use of cython.
pypy is unfortunately not an overall viable route due to no real support
for scipy and limited numpy support. pypy would be a quick win if it
were possible, so cython where applicable is the obvious choice.</p>
<p>Continue updating the code base to ensure that everything can be run on
&gt;= Python-3.5.x</p>
<p>UPDATE 20180526 - Skyline has not been cooperative here in terms of it’s own
roadmap and plotted course.</p>

<p>Functionality to allow the operator to flag false positives, with a view

set for training it, perhaps even using an entire namespace to increase the

<section id="constellations-updated-20150526-now-to-be-known-as-luminosity">
<h2>Constellations (Updated 20150526 now to be known as Luminosity)<a class="headerlink" href="#constellations-updated-20150526-now-to-be-known-as-luminosity" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A pure Python implementation of the Oculus functionality, but not
necessarily exactly the same, but similar. Calculating in realtime using
the redis data and fingerprinting the slope/gradient/alphabet of the
last x datapoints of each timeseries on the fly and correlating /
finding similarities in the timeseries in terms of patterns. Perhaps
some inplementation of Cosine Similarity could be used. A pure Python
implementation of Oculus functionality within Skyline would remove the
requirement for the additional overheads of ruby and Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>This would allow for the correlations to be determined for any metrics
at any point within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FULL_DURATION</span></code> period.</p>
<p>Help wanted.</p>
<p>UPDATE 20180526 - Skyline HAS been cooperative here and hooked up with
Linkedin/luminol to provide Skyline Luminosity and adding back the additional
dimension of correlations, it has managed to provide a fairly good root cause
analysis dimension to Skyline too.  Ticked. Although I still like the app
Skyline meme of Constellations, just have to think up or find another cool thing
(similarly related) to name Constellations.  No doubt in the next roadmap
edition, this may be updated with something like, “Skyline and other parties
have not been cooperative here.”  Take that as ode to yourselves Linkedin, the
name was even changed to fit in with paying homeage to your library, however if
the aim here is to be accurate the app should be called skyline/paulbourke…
Which gives me an idea :)</p>
<p>UPDATE 20180723 - Skyline HAS now been cooperative here and provided itself with
data under which some of the Constellations meme roadmap item could be reborn,
after being railroaded by Luminol and Luminosity.  It was a well liked meme and
it was difficult to accept and implement this meme functionality under anything
other than Luminosity.  However, now Luminosity is implemented, Skyline has once
again pushed its own roadmap forward, as now it needs try and learn/compute what
cross correlations are now strongly contextually related within the population
of cross correlations per anomaly.  A lot of cross correlations are purely valid
numeric correlations, however within the population of metrics, they often have
no contextual correlations to one another, one is not related to the other in
any way or form.</p>
<p>It is here Constellations can be reborn by an effort to try and develop a method
by which Skyline can learn/compute related metrics in a meaningful manner and
hopefully a useful manner.  Also try and learn/compute what metrics are never
related to each other.  Describe constellations and not in the literal sense,
constellations can be found in a constellation too.  Maps.  Map the population,
tribes, names, places, stars and know who is who, what is what, who did what, who
affects what, who affects what and what affects what.  Map it all, somehow.
Just thoughts and reflections on v1.2.0 thru v1.2.4, Skyline again has opened
itself another avenue of data from some added functionality.  Mapping and taming
the correlations.  This time if possible with no operator training, but simply
trying to learn/compute from all the available data.  Perhaps it can ask the
operator to review what it figured out and get their opinion on it.  Who knows
where this would go?  Through a lot of time undoubtedly, that much is certain.</p>

<section id="skyline-and-nasa-fits-data">
<h2>Skyline and NASA/FITS data<a class="headerlink" href="#skyline-and-nasa-fits-data" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There is a Skyline module in development that is specifically designed
for analysing Kepler FITS timeseries data. Although it specifically
focus at extracting lightcurve data from the Kepler llc.fits data files,
that in itself has added the functionality to convert any relevant FITS
based data file that has a timeseries element in it. This should extend
to other data types that the FITS data format (Flexible Image Transport
System) handles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Much more than just another image format (such as JPEG or GIF)</p></li>
<li><p>Used for the transport, analysis, and archival storage of scientific
data sets</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-dimensional arrays: 1D spectra, 2D images, 3D+ data cubes</p></li>
<li><p>Tables containing rows and columns of information</p></li>
<li><p>Header keywords provide descriptive information about the data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It should be possible for Skyline to be able to ingest any FITS data
file or ingest an image file from a FITS file and feed it to scikit-image,
etc.</p>
<p>UPDATE 20180526 - Skyline and other parties have not been cooperative here.</p>

<section id="nupic">
<h2>NuPIC<a class="headerlink" href="#nupic" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Last year <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numenta/nupic/">NuPIC</a> was assessed in terms of
use in Internet advertising for an additional monitoring dimension.  Although
the assessment was fairly brief, it’s predictive capabilities were quite
impressive.  Working with a 14 month data set for one advertising service it was
able to predict the service’s ad_requests per 10 minutes for the 14 month
period remarkably well given the nature of the specific domain.  The result was
a little peaky, with a few large peaks. Evaluation of the event streams from the
timeframes around the large peaks in question, identified known causes for
those peaks, with a “noise filter” applied to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exclude</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code> to reduce
those now known few noisy events and the result were indeed remarkable. In fact
NuPIC predicted our requests for 14 months within the bounds of ~5% error margin
and when it made and error, it learned.</p>
<p>Truly remarkable given this is adtech data, 6.5 million request per
minute peaks, low troughs with sparse seasonalities (if there is such
a thing) at times. NuPIC and the Cortical Learning Algorithm are really
amazing, if not a little difficult upfront.</p>

<h5>Update the NAB Scoreboard<a class="headerlink" href="#update-the-nab-scoreboard" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>Look at the automated running of the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)
data and frequently determine the Standard Profile, Reward Low FP and
Reward Low FN scores (metrics). This will only aid and improve the
evaluation of any additional algorithms, methods or techniques that are
added or applied to Skyline in the future, e.g:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does Mirage change the score?</p></li>
<li><p>Does Boundary?</p></li>
<li><p>Would the addition of pyculiarity as an “algorithm”?
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nicolasmiller/pyculiarity">https://github.com/nicolasmiller/pyculiarity</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Automated NAB benchmark metrics would be a nice thing to have :)</p>
<p><strong>Update 20170225</strong>: Skyline can no longer necessarily be NAB-ed due to it now
functioning in multiple temporal resolutions as a whole.</p>
<p>UPDATE 20180526 - Skyline and other parties have not been cooperative here.</p>
<p>UPDATE 20190412 - New Skyline scores were added to NAB see:
