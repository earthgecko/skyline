<p>Welcome to Skyline.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-skyline">
<h2>What is Skyline?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-skyline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Skyline v1.2.2 - For those interested in anomaly detection and deflection in
streamed time series data.</p>
<p>Anomaly deflection.  The obvious next evolution in the use of all the anomaly
detection data?</p>
<p>Skyline is a Python based anomaly detection/deflection stack that analyses,
anomaly detects, deflects, fingerprints and learns vast amounts of streamed
time series data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Skyline ingests streamed metric time series data - skyline/horizon</li>
<li>Skyline uses a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`CONSENSUS`</span></code> of 3-sigma algorithms to detect anomalies on
batch processed, streamed metric time series data - skyline/analyzer - anomaly
detector</li>
<li>It handles large and small seasonality in the data - skyline/mirage -
anomaly deflector and detector</li>
<li>You can train it on what is NOT anomalous and it learns - skyline/ionosphere -
anomaly deflector</li>
<li>It records all your anomalies - skyline/panorama - anomaly memory</li>
<li>It shows you all your data - skyline/webapp - anomaly view</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing as we desire our metrics to be not anomalous most of the time and we want
to know when they ARE anomalous and given the fact that we try and build systems
that try to behave within not anomalous bounds so they perform well, due to
this we have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A lot of metric time series data that are not anomalous most of the time.</li>
<li>A lot of data to train a system on what is NOT anomalous given a time series
data set, rather than simply focusing on what is anomalous, also focusing on
what is not anomalous.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this Skyline implements a novel time series similarities comparison
algorithm and a boundary layers methodology that generates fingerprints of time
series data using the sum of the values of features of the time series which
have been extracted using the tsfresh features extraction package -
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh">https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh</a> and evaluation against boundary layer
algorithms to determine whether a 3-sigma triggered anomaly is actually a normal,
known pattern in the data.</p>
<p>The Skyline-Ionosphere-Tsfresh Time Series Similairities Comparison Algorithm -
SITTSSCA first coined here :) compares the generated fingerprints of the two
time series and can determine if they closely resemble each other in terms of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>of the amount of &#8220;power/energy&#8221;, range and &#8220;movement&#8221; there is within the time
series data set somewhat like RMS - Erol Kalkan from United States Geological Survey,
“Another approach to compute the differences between two time series is moving
window root-mean-square. RMS can be run for both series separately. This way,
you can compare the similarities in energy (gain) level of time series. You
may vary the window length for best resolution.”
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_I_perform_time_series_data_similarity_measures_and_get_a_significance_level_p-value">https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_I_perform_time_series_data_similarity_measures_and_get_a_significance_level_p-value</a>)
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5613244/root-mean-square-in-numpy-and-complications-of-matrix-and-arrays-of-numpy">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5613244/root-mean-square-in-numpy-and-complications-of-matrix-and-arrays-of-numpy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Skyline-Ionosphere-Tsfresh Time Series Similairities Comparison Algorithm
compares how close the fingerprint values are as a percentage and
varying this percentage variable will either focusing the algorithm with greater
precision the closer to 0% the parameter gets, the perfect match (or possibly
a mirror match too - unkonwn/untested) or it will incrementally increase the
tolerance as the percentage variable increases and the matching will become
less and less reliable.</p>
<p>However there is a sweet spot and here SITTSSCA works extremely well :)</p>
<p>Added to SITTSSCA is an optional layer of simple boundary algorithms that are
user defined during the operator training interaction with Skyline, where the
operator augments the SITTSSCA results with boundaries that describe the
expected norm within the time series.  Very similar to being able to describe
the Active Brownian Motion of a time series -
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/pull/143#issuecomment-272314801">https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/pull/143#issuecomment-272314801</a></p>
<p>This results in an anomaly detection/deflection system which enables the user to
very simply label time series and train Skyline on the peaks and troughs and the
expected Active Brownian Motion or best effort thereof.</p>
<p>However it takes a little effort on your part to train Skyline, however with the
effort, Skyline is very good at doing anomaly detection and deflection.</p>
<p>With your help.  There is no easy anomaly detection or deflection, but there is
some reward with a bit of effort.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-you-need">
<h2>What you need<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-need" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You must be interested in doing real time anomaly detection on vast amounts of
time series data streams on a reasonable Linux VM (or in a container/s if you
were really committed).</p>
<p>You are still here.</p>
<p>You use Graphite as your time series data source?  No?</p>
<p>Currently Skyline needs Graphite, if you do not already have Graphite please
consider setting Graphite up and if you like that, come back.</p>
<p>If you are still here and reading this, then maybe you are serious about
installing and trying Skyline.  In which case a word of warning, continuing from
this point forward, will require a LOT of hours of your time.</p>
<p>Skyline is not some Python data science anomaly detection library, it is a full
blown production grade anomaly detection stack.  Although certain aspects of
Skyline may have interest to the data science community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-brief-history">
<h2>A brief history<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Skyline was originally open sourced by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> as a real-time anomaly detection
system. It was originally built to enable passive monitoring of hundreds of
thousands of metrics, without the need to configure a model/thresholds for each
one, as you might do with Nagios.  It was designed to be used wherever there are
a large quantity of high-resolution time series which need constant monitoring.
Once a metric stream was set up (from statsd, Graphite or other), additional
metrics are automatically added to Skyline for analysis, anomaly detection,
alerting and briefly published in the Webapp frontend.  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/etsy/skyline">github/etsy</a> stopped
actively maintaining Skyline in 2014.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="skyline-as-a-work-in-progress">
<h2>Skyline - as a work in progress<a class="headerlink" href="#skyline-as-a-work-in-progress" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> found the &#8220;one size fits all approach&#8221; to anomaly detection wasn&#8217;t
actually proving all that useful to them.</p>
<p>There is <strong>some truth</strong> in that in terms of the one size fits all methodology that
Skyline was framed around.  With hundreds of thousands of metrics this does make
Skyline fairly hard to tame, in terms of how useful it is and tuning the noise
is difficult.  Tuning the noise to make it constantly useful and not just noisy,
removes the &#8220;without the need to configure a model/thresholds&#8221; element somewhat.</p>
<p>So why continue developing Skyline?</p>
<p>The first way to make Skyline MUCH better than the manner it was implemented and
framed by Etsy, is to <strong>NOT</strong> try and use it to anomaly detect on 1000s of
metrics in the first place.  Using Skyline as a scapel rather than a sword.</p>
<p>Within in this paradigm, Skyline has been much improved in many ways and is
very useful at doing anomaly detection on your KEY metrics.  The ongoing
development of Skyline has been focused on improving Skyline in the following
ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Improving the anomaly detection methodologies used in the 3-sigma context.</li>
<li>Extending Skyline&#8217;s 3-sigma methodology to enable the operator and Skyline to
handle seasonality in metrics.</li>
<li>The addition of an anomalies database for learning and root cause analysis.</li>
<li>Adding the ability for the operator to teach Skyline and have Skyline learn
things that are NOT anomalous using a time series similarities comparison
method based on features extraction and comparison using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh">tsfresh</a>
package.  With Ionosphere we are training Skyline on what is NOT anomalous,
rather than focusing on what is anomalous.  Ionosphere allows us to train
Skyline as to what is normal, even if normal includes spikes and dips and
seasonality.  After all we have some expectation that most of our metrics
would be NOT anomalous most of the time, rather than anomalous most of the
time.  So training Skyline what is NOT ANOMALOUS is more efficient than trying
to label anomalies.</li>
<li>Adding the ability to Skyline to determine what other metrics are related to
an anomaly event using cross correlation analysis of all the metrics using
Linkedin&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/linkedin/luminol">luminol</a> library when an anomaly event is triggered and
recording these in the database to assist in root cause analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>And...</p>
<p>The architecture/pipeline works very well at doing what it does.  It is solid
and battle tested..</p>
<p>Skyline is <strong>FAST</strong>!!!  Faster enough to handle 10s of 1000s of time series in
near real time.  In the world of Python, data analysis, R and most machine
learning, Skyline is FAST.  Processing and analysing 1000s and 1000s of
constantly changing time series, every minute of every day and it can do it in
multiple resolutions, on a fairly low end commodity server.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-new-look-of-skyline-apps">
<h2>The new look of Skyline apps<a class="headerlink" href="#the-new-look-of-skyline-apps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Horizon - feed metrics to Redis via a pickle input from Graphite/s</li>
<li>Analyzer - analyses metrics with 3-sigma algorithms</li>
<li>Mirage - analyses specific metrics at a custom time range with 3-sigma algorithms</li>
<li>Boundary - analyses specific time series for specific conditions</li>
<li>Crucible - store anomalous time series resources and adhoc analysis of any
time series</li>
<li>Panorama - anomalies database, historical views and root cause analysis</li>
<li>Webapp - frontend to view current and historical anomalies, training data,
features profiles, layers, matches and can browse Redis with
<span class="red">re</span><span class="brow">brow</span> and you manage Skyline&#8217;s learning with it</li>
<li>Ionosphere - time series fingerprinting and learning</li>
<li>Luminosity - Cross correlation of metrics for root cause analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Skyline is still a near real time anomaly detection system, however it has
various modes of operation that are modular and self contained, so that only the
desired apps need to be enabled, although the stack is now much more useful with
them all running.  This modular nature also isolated the apps from one another
in terms of operation, meaning an error or failure in one does not necessarily
the others.</p>
<p>Skyline can now be feed/query and analyse time series on an adhoc basis, on the
fly.  This means Skyline can now be used to analyse and process static data too,
it is no longer just a machine/app metric fed system, if anyone wanted to use
it to analyse historic data.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-s-old">
<h2>What&#8217;s old<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-old" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It must be stated the original core of Skyline has not been altered in any way,
other than some fairly minimal Pythonic performance improvements, a bit of
optimization in terms of the logic used to reach <a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#settings.CONSENSUS" title="settings.CONSENSUS"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">settings.CONSENSUS</span></code></a> and a
package restructure.  In terms of the original Skyline Analyzer, it does the
same things just a little differently, hopefully better and a bit more.</p>
<p>There is little point in trying to improve something as simple and elegant in
methodology and design as Skyline, which has worked so outstandingly well to
date.  This is a testament to a number of things, in fact the sum of all it&#8217;s
parts, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>, Abe and co. did a great job in the conceptual design,
methodology and actual implementation of Skyline and they did it with very good
building blocks from the scientific community.</p>
