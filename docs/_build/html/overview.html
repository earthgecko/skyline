<h1>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Skyline is a Python based time series analysis and performance monitoring application
that helps you to monitor and better understand complex systems and their
interactions.  Skyline provides a unique kind of performance monitoring by using
real time anomaly detection, threshold and dynamic threshold analysis, user
input/training for machine learning with various correlation methods, to provide
structured data sets of significant changes within metric populations.</p>
<section id="features">
<h2>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Skyline use the most appropriate state of the art algorithms for real time
anomaly detection.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses multi stage analysis and filtering to allow for the use of more time complex
algorithms to be applied in the real time domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Puts the user in control of false positive detections by allowing for
simple user input to provide explainable ML methods with training data which
massively reduce false positive detections and provides the system with data
to begin learning with.</p></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is anomaly detection and time series analysis performance monitoring good for?</strong></p>
<p>It is extremely useful in the operations and development arenas, to highlight a
few use cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In operations monitoring to provide a real time feed of significant changes
and related events in your systems, the good, the bad and the unknown and
unseen.</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling developers to monitor components of their development environment
helping them to build for performance by giving them a real time view of any
performance related impacts any new feature may introduce.  For example a
developer may create a new feature that periodically runs analysis on some
data from a MySQL database.  The developer builds the feature, tests it to
ensures that it provides the required functionality and releases the feature.
The feature works but it introduces an additional 225K of
<cite>mysql.handler_read_next</cite> operations on every run, which were not there before
the feature was released.  The developer method works, but it could work much
better.  Skyline provides the developer with information to enable them to be
the best they can be in terms of performance and understanding impacts, in a
areas where they may have zero or little domain knowledge, such as the
internal metrics of MySQL/MariaDB.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="mysql.handler_read_next" src="_images/mysql.handler_read_next.png" />
</figure>
<p>Our work can always be better.</p>
<p>The question is why are we <strong>NOT</strong> doing anomaly detection on our things?
Shouldn’t we be analysing our observability data?
If the 3 pillars of observability are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>logs</p></li>
<li><p>metrics</p></li>
<li><p>traces</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do pillars hold up?</p>
<p>Data analysis is the next generation of the observability stack, o11y 1.0
was about collection, storage, retrieval and presentation.  Anomaly detection is
is a part of the next generation of observability, putting all that data to use
in real time - analysis.</p>
<p><strong>What can Skyline be compared to</strong></p>
<p>Although it may seem that there are various services and applications that might
be compared to Skyline, in reality most of them are not comparable, for a variety
of reason.</p>
<p>Google, AWS and Azure all have some kind of anomaly detection service for timeseries
data, but those services are generally one trick ponies or one or two trick black
boxes.</p>
<p>What none of those are is a dedicated, multi stage analysis pipeline with first and
foremost human in the loop in terms of configuration, choice and model training.</p>
<p>Skyline currently allows for 12 analysis stages by default implementing a number
of different analysis methods:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>analyzer - 3-sigma (to stage 2 if anomalous at 24h)</p></li>
<li><p>mirage - 3-sigma (to stage 3 if anomalous at 7d)</p></li>
<li><p>mirage - matrixprofile (to stage 4 if anomalous at 7d)</p></li>
<li><p>mirage - anomalous_daily_peaks (to stage 5 if not a normal daily peak)</p></li>
<li><p>mirage - irregular_unstable (to stage 6 if true or to stage 7 if not true and trained instances available)</p></li>
<li><p>mirage - 3-sigma/matrixprofile/spectral_residual (to stage 7 if anomalous at 30d and trained instances available)</p></li>
<li><p>ionosphere - motif matching on 24h trained data (to stage 8 if no matches found)</p></li>
<li><p>ionosphere - motif matching on 7d trained data (to stage 9 if no matches found)</p></li>
<li><p>ionosphere - features extracted and compared to 24h trained data (to stage 10 if no matches found)</p></li>
<li><p>ionosphere - minmax features extracted and compared to 24h minmax trained data (to stage 11 if no matches found)</p></li>
<li><p>ionosphere - features extracted and compared to 7d trained data (to stage 12 if no matches found)</p></li>
<li><p>ionosphere - minmax features extracted and compared to 7d minmax trained data</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Skyline is unique.  It is the only real open source anomaly detection system, that
allows for state of the art (SOTA) on realtime data and plugs into our existing
telemetry systems to enable realtime anomaly detection on your metrics and even
traces (converted to metrics).</p>
<p>Skyline allows you to specify what algorithms to run, and even allows you to add
your own, it allows you to provide the system with valid training data with the
click of a button.  It records all anomalies, analysis results and reports on
performance on a per metric basis.  You can even evaluate your own or other
algorithms in the real time pipeline, without having them influence the outcome
of any existing analysis.  This allows for benchmarking the actual performance of
algorithms on your own real data.</p>
<p>And it is cluster ready for production.  However be warned, it is a complex stack
to set up and implement, once running it is fine, it bit like my Mercedes MB120
van which has 662000 km on the clock.  However, like my van, it runs perfectly
fine but when it comes to upgrading all the components and the app itself is a
fairly large slice of orchestrated work, not for the faint hearted.</p>
<p><strong>human-in-the-loop</strong></p>
<p>The use multi-stage analysis and multiple algorithms decreases false positive
detections.  However false positives are inevitable so the user can easily train
Skyline, which enables massive reductions in false positives by utilising
extracted features and shapelets/motifs from the user trained time series and running
various state of the art similarity search methods against potentially anomalous
instances of data.  These methods are <strong>extremely accurate</strong> and achieving a False
negative rate of ~0.34% on a sample of 1000 matches from 246799 matches
achieved over a period a 55 month period on the real time analysis of production
system and application metrics.  Meaning that the system flagged an instance of
data as matching a trained instance of data incorrectly only 838 times and it
matched correctly 245961 times over the 55 month period.</p>
<p><strong>Your</strong> input is more <strong>valuable</strong> than you know or even imagine!
Even though you may think you know nothing or very little about metrics, you and
your brain can be magnificent.</p>
<p>In the world of machine learning achieving a 0.34% error rate on classifications
is not bad, whether that be unsupervised, semi-supervised or a supervised
machine learning algorithm, 0.34% is <strong>not</strong> bad, it is within acceptable
limits in the context of what it is doing.</p>
<p>It must be caveated that this error rate can be affected by data quality,
currently no checks are implemented to ensure that the potentially anomalous
timeseries being checked is the same length or at least similar length to the
trained data set to which it is being compared.  Although the SITTSSCA method is
fairly robust to some missing data, more dissimilar length timeseries will
produce increasingly dissimilar features and the chance of them matching
decreases quite rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Skyline is built for speed.</strong></p>
<p>The analysis stages move from very simple and efficient algorithms, to more
complex and specialised algorithms through the analysis pipeline. This ensures
that more computationally expensive analysis is only carried out when it is
needed and all analysis is conducted as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Every optimisation that can be found is implemented, whether that be optimising
a 0.077915 second operation to 0.005692 seconds with the use of bottleneck
rather than pandas or finding optimisations in the algorithmic methodologies and
pipeline and gaining wherever possible on suitable algorithms/methods with numba
JIT compiled algorithms, every millisecond counts.  We are not talking about
nanoseconds here because we are dealing with big data sets, so we must be realistic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately no single anomaly detection algorithm or method or service is
perfect.  Using any a single method to do anomaly detection is a flawed
approach and achieves suboptimal long term results.  Anomaly detection is a
constantly shifting space with new methodologies/papers/libraries published
almost daily.  However the truth is that real world, real time implementations
of high volume and high frequency metrics of many of these new
methodologies/papers/libraries published are very few and far between.  And
often they do not fit into the real time space, for many reasons, a few are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>computational time complexity</p></li>
<li><p>need for tuned hyperparameters on different types of data sets</p></li>
<li><p>need for labelled data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Skyline attempts to implement methods that work with zero domain knowledge, as
the system runs and records data, it uses the data it creates itself to do zero
knowledge discovery of relationships in the metrics and learn about them.</p>
<p>Anomaly detection is not simply about fault detection and identifying problems,
anomaly detection is about describing significant changes.  Skyline creates a
real time event stream of significant changes to inform the user of what is
happening on their systems, applications and metrics of interest. Do not think
of Skyline as an alerting system, think of it as an event stream that can be
trained.</p>
<p>Skyline teaches you about your systems and allows you to train it on what is
normal.  You can even configure it to try and learn for its self from what you
trained it on.</p>
<p>Skyline runs on Linux on commodity hardware or a cloud instance.</p>
<p>At its core Skyline can currently makes use of the uses the following algorithms
(or modifications thereof):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>9 three-sigma based algorithms, derived from Shewhart’s statistical process</p></li>
<li><p>SITTSSCA - Skyline-Ionosphere-Tsfresh Time Series Similarities Comparison Algorithm</p></li>
