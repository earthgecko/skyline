<h1>Ionosphere<a class="headerlink" href="#ionosphere" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Ionosphere is a story about time series.</p>
<p>Dedicated to my father, Derek, a man of numbers if there ever was one.</p>
<section id="what-ionosphere-is-for-humble-beginnings">
<h2>What Ionosphere is for - humble beginnings<a class="headerlink" href="#what-ionosphere-is-for-humble-beginnings" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><strong>YOU</strong> can teach a system.</p>
<p><strong>YOU</strong> can help a system to LEARN.</p>
<p>You want to monitor metrics on small VPSs that do not do a great deal, meaning
there is no high, rate constant work or 3sigma consistency in the metrics.
There are 0 to 7 apache.sending a day, not 7000 a minute. Or there are some
peaks on the metric stats_counts.statsd.bad_lines_seen</p>
<img alt="_images/21060819.stats_counts.statsd.bad_lines_seen.png" src="_images/21060819.stats_counts.statsd.bad_lines_seen.png" />
<p>This is <span class="red">NOT ANOMALOUS</span></p>
<p>Even in massive, workload intensive, dynamic systems there are always some
metrics that are low rate and relatively low range.  And at 3sigma… that means
noisy.</p>
<p>Ionosphere’s goal is to allow us to train Skyline on what is not anomalous and
thereby compliment statistical 3simga means with some new methodologies of
trying to “teach” the system.  Of course teaching statistics algorithms
something new is unfortunately not possible, but luckily teaching the system is
possible.  Giving the system better contextual data to work with is the key
factor.</p>
<p>While a lot of work and research in the anomaly detection and machine learning
domain is focused at automatically finding anomalies and getting it right,
Skyline Ionosphere actually does somewhat of the opposite.</p>
<p>With Ionosphere we are training Skyline on what is NOT ANOMALOUS, rather than
focusing on what is anomalous.  Ionosphere allows us to train Skyline as to what
is normal, even if normal includes spikes and dips and seasonality.</p>

<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ionosphere gives the operator an input into Skyline to allow them to train it
and compliment the existing statistical 3sigma anomaly detection methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Ionosphere then starts to learn, <strong>retrospectively</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is Ionosphere the panacea for anomaly detection?  No.</p></li>
<li><p>Is Ionosphere immediately useful for web scale anomaly detection?  No.  Unless
you are already doing web scale anomaly detection with Skyline, then still no.
However over time yes.  You cannot rush time series.</p></li>
<li><p>Is Ionosphere a lot of work to train, yes.</p></li>
<li><p>Ionosphere uses a time series similarity comparison method to compare two
different time series for a metric.</p></li>
<li><p>This method is based on summing the features that are calculated for the
time series using <a href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh" target="_blank">tsfresh</a> to “fingerprint” the data set.</p></li>
<li><p>This allows the operator to fingerprint and profile what is not anomalous, but
normal and to be expected, even if 3sigma will always detect it as anomalous.</p></li>
<li><p>Further to this, Ionosphere uses the trained data to create 1000s of motifs
(small patterns) of what normal is and supplements the feature profile
comparisons by evaluating the current potentially anomaly against the 1000s of
trained normal motifs from the features profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>Ionosphere also allows for the creation of layers rules which allow the
operator to define ad hoc boundaries and conditions that can be considered as
not anomalous for each features profile that is created.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-well-does-it-work">
<h2>How well does it work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-well-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is a graph of the impact that Ionosphere has had on the anomaly count of
<cite>ionosphere_enabled</cite> metrics before and after the deployment of Ionosphere.</p>
<img alt="_images/ionosphere_impact_on_anomaly_count.png" src="_images/ionosphere_impact_on_anomaly_count.png" />
<p>It is clear that when the features profiles and layers are introduced and
Skyline starts to learn, the anomaly counts for metrics that have been trained
drop significantly, but it is not perfect.</p>
<p>Significant events which happen infrequently and change machine metrics
significantly are still difficult to handle.  Things like the occasional
importing of a DB, reboots, zipping up a bunch of things, however layers do
allow one to “describe” these events on metrics as normal should they so wish.</p>
<p>And Ionosphere does <strong>not</strong> make handling downtime and missing data points in
metrics any easier, in fact it can make it harder.</p>
<p>“Do I want to train Skyline to think that the hole in this metric for 10 hours
yesterday while OVH had 2 x 20 Kv lines down and generator problems in France,
is normal?  Maybe I should wait a week before training Skyline on any metrics
that have been OVH’d…”</p>

<section id="deploying-and-setting-ionosphere-up">
<h2>Deploying and setting Ionosphere up<a class="headerlink" href="#deploying-and-setting-ionosphere-up" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Requires - Panorama to be enabled and running.</p>
<p>Ionosphere has a specific section of variables in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.py</span></code> that are
documented in the settings specific documentation see all the settings below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#settings.IONOSPHERE_CHECK_PATH" title="settings.IONOSPHERE_CHECK_PATH"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.IONOSPHERE_CHECK_PATH</span></code></a> - <a class="reference external" href="http://earthgecko-skyline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/skyline.html#settings.IONOSPHERE_CHECK_PATH">http://earthgecko-skyline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/skyline.html#settings.IONOSPHERE_CHECK_PATH</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Ionosphere settings follow normal Skyline settings conventions in terms of
being able to paint all metrics with certain defaults and allowing for specific
settings for specific or wildcard namespaces.  If you know Skyline then these
should all be fairly intuitive.</p>
<p>If you are new to Skyline, then by the time you have all the other Skyline apps
set up and running you should have a more intuitive feel for these to after
having spent some time looking over your running Skyline.  You cannot rush
time series :)</p>

<p>The demo pages show examples of how Ionosphere presents the operator with the
metric’s details for the specific point anomaly and the all the Graphite
metric graphs at multiple resolutions so that the operator can evaluation the
anomaly in the full context of the metric’s history.</p>

<h3>Graphs demo page - multiple resolution Graphite graphs for context<a class="headerlink" href="#graphs-demo-page-multiple-resolution-graphite-graphs-for-context" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The demo page uses an edge case anomaly one which is not easy to decide whether
it is or is not an anomaly.</p>
<p>Would <strong>YOU</strong> consider it anomalous or not?  Would you want an alert?</p>
<p>Note that this is demo page is from an older version of Ionosphere before learn
was introduced.  So it does not give the operator the 2 options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create features profile and DO NOT LEARN</p></li>
<li><p>Create features profile and LEARN</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It only gives the one option, however this demo page is about the <strong>multiple

<p>A point anomaly is only as contextually as the time frame in which it is
considered to be anomalous in.</p>
<p>The following metaphor can be used to describe this concept.  As this concept is
important to understand in terms of Ionosphere and Mirage.</p>

San Francisco because he landed a good job at a cool San Jose data analytics
upstart.  In the first week he is there, the Bay Area has a few Earth tremors,
to Bob from the UK this is ANOMALOUS!!! Luckily Bob has a friendly co-worker
called Alice and she directs him to <a class="reference external" href="http://earthquaketrack.com/us-ca-san-jose/recent">http://earthquaketrack.com/us-ca-san-jose/recent</a>
and shows him it is not that anomalous, it is quite normal.  Alice shows Bob to
consider the context of these events in at a fuller duration.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>5 earthquakes in the past 24 hours</p></li>
<li><p>5 earthquakes in the past 7 days</p></li>

<p>And the penny drops for Bob that HERE in the Bay Area this is obviously this
quite normal.</p>
<p>Bob then wonders to himself why he did not think about this before leaving
his stable shire in the UK.  He consoles himself by thinking “Well all the VCs

failure.</p>

<p>So Ionosphere gives you 2 options:</p>

<p>This means you do not have to ship that earthquake that happened 17 days ago into
Ionosphere’s features profiles and teach it BAD, badly.  You can just tell it
to see the relevant Analyzer <a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#settings.FULL_DURATION" title="settings.FULL_DURATION"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.FULL_DURATION</span></code></a> or Mirage the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SECOND_ORDER_RESOLUTION_HOURS</span></code> data as not anomalous and <strong>not</strong> learn at
the fuller duration of the metric’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">learn_full_duration</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can teach Ionosphere badly, but to “unteach” it is just a click of the Disable
features profile button.</p>
<p>Use Ionosphere learning sparingly, although it is a feature, it will also
generates an ongoing requirement for you to review and validate what it has
learnt.</p>
<p>Skyline learning is not perfect.  There are certain metrics that learning seems
not to work as well on as other metrics, 5min and 15min load_average metrics
fall into this category.  Do not go overboard on learning do it slowly and
incrementally.  All LEARNT features profiles have the ability to be validated,
however this is not a hard requirement, unvalidated features profiles will still
be used in analysis, the validated flag is currently simply there to give the
operator a view of what LEARNT features profiles have not been assessed to
determine their accuracy.  Skyline will also LEARN from an unvalidated features
profile.  Therefore the operator needs to review and validate or disable
features profiles every so often, this can be achieved when reviewing and
training on not anomalous patterns is done, whenever training data for a metric
is assessed it is easy to review all features profiles for that metric during
this phase by using the <span class="skyblue">Existing ::</span> <span class="red">features profiles page link</span>
on the training page and using the Ionosphere Validate page for side-by-side
comparisons.</p>
<p>To begin with try and start with only creating features profiles and only
implementing learning very occasionally when you are certain that a metric has a
very “normal” pattern over 30 days.  Initially just creating features profiles
and not trying to learn on all of them, will give you a good idea of what
Skyline Ionosphere is doing when you look at the Ionosphere matches pages and
review matches.  Having a few learn features profiles as well, will also give
you a good idea of what is being done when Skyline is learning, when you look
at the Ionosphere features profiles page and reviewing the <span class="red">learnt</span>
features profiles on the <span class="skyblue">Search ::</span> <span class="red">features profiles</span> page.</p>

percentage difference to learn with, it is going to get some learning wrong as
far as we humans are concerned.  Due to the algorithm using a percentage
difference and not exact matches means that occasionally Ionosphere is going to
learn badly, which is often the case with load_avg metrics it seems and this
will also happen sometimes when there is missing data in a time series.
Ensure that you review and validate LEARNT features profiles often to ensure
that incorrect LEARNT features profiles are disabled as soon as possible.</p>

up silencing genuine anomalies which you would <strong>want</strong> to be alerted on.

<h2>How Ionosphere works - a simple overview<a class="headerlink" href="#how-ionosphere-works-a-simple-overview" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Firstly one needs to understand there is a chicken and egg aspect to Ionosphere.
Which if you have read up to this point, hopefully you have already got that
point.</p>
<p>Ionosphere has a number of roles that are centered on feature extractions,
feature calculations and comparisons and a role centered on learning.</p>
<section id="the-features-role">
<h3>The features role<a class="headerlink" href="#the-features-role" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The features role is based on the sum of the calculated features of a time series.
What are calculated features?  Between 150 and 210 features are calculated, here
are a few examples:</p>

Ionosphere calculates the features and then then use the sum of these values.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ionosphere <strong>only</strong> analyses SMTP alerter enabled metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Once Ionosphere is enabled, if Analyzer or Mirage detect an anomaly on a

<li><p>If the metric is not an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ionosphere_enabled</span></code> metric and a SMTP alert enabled

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ionosphere serves the training data set for each triggered anomaly, ready for
a human to come along in the Webapp Ionosphere UI and say, “that is not
anomalous” (if it is not).</p></li>
<li><p>At the point the operator makes a features profile, all the features values
that are created for the not anomalous time series are entered into the
database and the metric becomes an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ionosphere_enabled</span></code> metric, if it was
not one already.</p></li>
<li><p>All the anomaly resources are then copied to the specific features profile
directory that is created for the features profile.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a metric is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ionosphere_enabled</span></code>, both Analyzer and Mirage will refer
any anomalies found for the metric to Ionosphere instead of just alerting.</p></li>
<li><p>When a 3sigma anomalous time series is sent to Ionosphere, it calculates the
features with <a href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh" target="_blank">tsfresh</a> for the 3sigma anomalous time series and then compares
the common features sums with those of previously recorded features profiles.
If the two values are less than

Ionosphere will deem the time series as not anomalous and update the related
training data as MATCHED and update the features profile matched count in the
database.</p></li>
<li><p>If the values are not matched Ionosphere will apply Min-Max scaling (ONLY if
the features profile time series and the anomalous time series are of a
similar range) and try the same technique with temporary Min-Max scaled time
series from the original features profile time series (which is stored in the
database) and the 3sigma anomalous time series.  It creates a features profile
for each Min-Max scaled (standardized) time series and then compares the
features sums and determines whether the difference is below the

will deem it as not anomalous and update the related training data as MATCHED
and update the features profile matched count in the database.</p></li>
<li><p>If Ionosphere does <strong>not</strong> find a features profile match, it analyses the time
series against any defined layers, if there are any and if a match is found
Ionosphere will deem the time series as not anomalous and update the related
training data as MATCHED and update the features profile layers matched count
in the database.</p></li>
<li><p>If Ionosphere does <strong>not</strong> find a match, it tells the originating app
(Analyzer or Mirage) to send out the anomaly alert with a

<p>When an anomaly alert is sent out via email, a link to the Ionosphere training

training data for the specific anomaly where the user can submit the metric
time series as not anomalous and have Skyline generate a features profile with

on this page).</p>
</section>
<section id="features-profiles">
<h2>features profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#features-profiles" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When a training data set is submitted as not anomalous for a metric a features
profile is extracted from the time series using <a href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh" target="_blank">tsfresh</a>.  This features profile
contains the values of 210 features (currently as of tsfresh-0.4.0), such
as median, mean, variance, etc, for a full list of known features that are
calculated see <a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#tsfresh_feature_names.TSFRESH_FEATURES" title="tsfresh_feature_names.TSFRESH_FEATURES"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tsfresh_feature_names.TSFRESH_FEATURES</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>This features profile is then stored in the Skyline MySQL database in the
following manner.  For every metric that has a features profile that is created,
2 MySQL InnoDB tables are created for the metric.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The features profile details are inserted into the ionosphere table and the
features profile gets a unique id.</p></li>
<li><p>z_fp_&lt;metric_id&gt; - features profile metric table which contains the features
profile id, feature name id and the calculated value of the feature.</p></li>
<li><p>z_ts_&lt;metric_id&gt; - the time series data for the metric on which a features
profile was calculated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These tables are prefixed with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">z_</span></code> so that they are all listed after all core
Skyline database tables.  Once a metric has a z_fp_&lt;metric_id&gt; and a
z_ts_&lt;metric_id&gt; table, these tables are updated with any future features
profiles and time series data.  So there is are 2 tables per metric, not tables
per features profile.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Just a note on when features are extracted.  The user may notice that
when they extract features on a training data set, that sometimes they are
advised that the features were “previously calculated by Ionosphere” and
sometimes not.  This is because if the metric has been previously trained,
it is an Ionosphere metric and Ionosphere will have extracted the features
to analyse the metric.  If the metric has not been previously trained then
no features will have been extracted by Ionosphere and the features will be
extracted when the user requests them.  This is for the sake of efficiency,
there is no need to add computational overhead to extract features on every
anomaly.</p>

</section>
<section id="how-ionosphere-is-learning">
<h2>How Ionosphere is “learning”?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-ionosphere-is-learning" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Ionosphere may have had humble beginnings, but adding this seemingly trivial
function was anything but humble, simple or easy.  So to solve the seemingly
simple problem, something completely new had to be pieced together.</p>
<p>Ionosphere “learns” time series and makes decisions based on a time series
similarities comparison method using the <a href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh" target="_blank">tsfresh</a> package.</p>
<p>This “learning” is base upon determining the similarities in time series that
could be best described as attempting to determine how similar 2 time series are
in terms of the amount of “power/energy”, range and “movement” there is within
the time series data set.  A fingerprint or signature if you like, but understand
that neither are perfect.  This time series similarities comparison method is not
perfect in the dynamic, operational arena, but it achieves the goal of being useful.
However, it must be stated that it <strong>can</strong> be almost perfect, a <a href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh" target="_blank">tsfresh</a> features
profile sum is (about as) <strong>perfect</strong> as you can get at 0% difference (there may
be edge cases).  However using it with 100% matching is not useful to learning
and trying to profile something like the Active Brownian Motion (for want of a
better way of explaining it).  Lots of dynamic metrics/systems will exhibit a
tendency to try an achieve Active Brownian Motion, not all but many and
definitely at differing and sometimes multiple seasonality.</p>
<p>For a very good overview of Active Brownian Motion please see the &#64;kempa-liehr
description at</p>
<div class="admonition seealso">
<p class="admonition-title">See also</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/pull/143#issuecomment-272314801">https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/pull/143#issuecomment-272314801</a> -
“Dynamic systems have stable and unstable fixed points. Without noise these
systems would be driven to one of their stable fixed points and stay there for
ever. So, fixed points resemble an equilibrium state”</p>
</div>
<p>Ionosphere enables us to try and profile something similar to Active Brownian
Motion as the norm, again for want of a better way of trying to explain it.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Ionosphere does not use Min-Max scaling in the learning context</p>
</div>
<p>However, contextually, Ionosphere nor the <a href="https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh" target="_blank">tsfresh</a> implemented method, will ever
be perfect, unless 2 time series have identical data, consistently, without
change.  But how challenging would that be? :)</p>
<p>Also it may be possible that an identical time series reversed may give the same
or negative of a features sum and a mirror image time series can have very
similar calculated feature sums.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is not perfect, by design.  Evolution tends to not achieve perfection,
attaining a working, functional state is usually the norm in evolution it seems.</p>
<section id="evolutionary-learning-generations">
<h3>Evolutionary learning - generations<a class="headerlink" href="#evolutionary-learning-generations" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Ionosphere uses an evolutionary learning model that records (and limits) the
generations of trained and learnt features profiles per metric.  Limits can be
set in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.py</span></code> and played around with.  For veterans of Skyline, these
tend to be much like <a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#settings.CONSENSUS" title="settings.CONSENSUS"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.CONSENSUS</span></code></a>, what is the correct <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CONSENSUS</span></code>?</p>
<p>They are tweak and tunable.  Keep them low, you give Ionosphere less
leverage to learn.  But you will bump them up so that it can learn more and
better.</p>
<p>Although this documentation may seem overly chatty and verbose, all things have
stories.  And why should documentation be overly dull, try explaining Skyline
to someone, good luck.  You should see me at parties.  Anyway not many people
read this, so it does not really matter :)</p>
<p>If you want to understand Skyline more, look at the code.  But be gentle :)</p>
<p>Or better yet, set it up.  Being able to teach a system and see it learn it
pretty cool, just look at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning">https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning</a>
and NeuroEvolution.js (thanks for the inspiration from &#64;nylar and &#64;xviniette)</p>
<p>Lots of Skyline concepts are easy enough to get, some are not so easy and when
they are all tied together with a splash of seasonality and a dash of
similarities, it gets quite complicated.</p>
<p>However, all Skyline pieces, individually, are relatively simple.  Seeing them

“Shit lots of stuff is anomalous” can often lead to lots of work, debugging,

<h3>DISABLED features profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#disabled-features-profiles" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Ionosphere learning is not perfect, sometimes it will get it wrong as far as a
human is concerned.  Luckily that does not happen often, but it will happen.</p>
<p>Ionosphere lets the operator disable any features profile that they deem as
anomalous.  This can be due to a features profile having been LEARNT and the
operator thinks it to be anomalous or an operator could create a features
profile that they decide was in error, this can especially be true when on
re-evaluating after creating with the “and LEARN” option enabled, but looking at
the 30 day data and thinking… “hmmm actually I do not really want it to learn
that spike from 2 weeks ago”.</p>
<p>If a features profile is DISABLED, all its progeny features profiles are
disabled as well.  This ensures that every features profile was LEARNT from the
profile and any that were LEARNT from any of them are disabled too so that the
pattern is removed from evaluation during analysis of the metric in the future.</p>

<section id="layers">
<h2>Layers<a class="headerlink" href="#layers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Ionosphere allows the operator to train Skyline a not anomalous time series
in terms of generating a features profile to be compared to anomalies in the
future, however Ionosphere also allows the operator to define “layers” rules at
the time of feature profile creation.</p>
<p>Layers rules allow us to train Skyline on boundaries as well, on the fly via the
UI at the time of features profile creation, which puts all the work for the
operator in the one place.  Think of them as metric AND feature profile specific
algorithms.  A layer should only ever be used to describe the features profile
and ONLY at <a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#settings.FULL_DURATION" title="settings.FULL_DURATION"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.FULL_DURATION</span></code></a> time series.  The operator should
limit their layers values to within acceptable bounds of the range within the
features profile.  The operator should not try and use a single layer to try and
describe the entire range they “think” the metric can go to, a layer is meant to
match with a features profile, not a metric, however see the Matching
approximately close section immediate below. If this methodology is followed,
layers and features profiles “retire” around the same time as metrics change
over time, an old features profile that no longer describes the current active
motion state will no longer ever be matched, neither should its layers.  One of
the things some way down the road on the Ionosphere roadmap is
Feature #1888: Ionosphere learn - evolutionary maturity forget</p>
<p>Layers were added to reduce the number of features profiles one has to train
Skyline on.  They were introduced for humans and to make it easier and more
useful.  However they come at a cost.  Every layer created reduces Ionosphere’s
opportunities to be trained and learn.  It is a compromise to save on the amount
of monkeys you have to have or need to be to train Skyline properly.  Unfortunately
someone has to be the monkey, but for every features profile/layer you create,
you create a Skyline monkey to watch that.  A monkey with fairly simple
instructions.</p>
<p>A layer consist of a series of simple algorithms that are run against a
time series after Analyzer/Mirage and Ionosphere features comparisons.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is IMPORTANT to understand that layers are only evaluated against
the <a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#settings.FULL_DURATION" title="settings.FULL_DURATION"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.FULL_DURATION</span></code></a> time series, regardless if it is a Mirage
metric being checked.  The operator should define their layers values in
relation to the Redis graph that is presented in the Train :: layers section
and to the Last :: 30 datapoints :: at FULL_DURATION section just below that
section, to ensure they are using relevant ranges.</p>
</div>
<p>When you create a layers on a features profile, initially do try to validated
them when they are matched, just to ensure they are behaving as you desire.
Once you have validated that the layer is behaving as you wish, you should
never have to worry about an invalid layer match thereafter.  However, do ensure
that you just try to validate a few layers every now and then.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="skyline.html#settings.IONOSPHERE_LAYERS_USE_APPROXIMATELY_CLOSE" title="settings.IONOSPHERE_LAYERS_USE_APPROXIMATELY_CLOSE"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings.IONOSPHERE_LAYERS_USE_APPROXIMATELY_CLOSE</span></code></a> variable
enables a margin of tolerance to be applied to layers D and E.  This is enabled
by default and D and E boundary limits are matched if the value is approximately
close to the limit.  This is only implemented on boundary values that are &gt; 10.
The approximately close value is calculated as 10 percent for limit values
between 11 and 29 and within 5 percent when the limit value &gt;= 30.  It is only
applied to the D layer with a ‘&gt;’ or ‘&gt;=’ condition and to the E layer with a
‘&lt;’ or ‘&lt;=’ condition.  This makes the layers more effect and means that if a
limit on a layer is set to 52 and the data point is 53, the layer will match
and you probably want it to as well.  If approximately_close is not used you
will find it frustrating the number of times an anomaly is triggered where it
did not match a layer by small margin.</p>

<h3>How layers are defined<a class="headerlink" href="#how-layers-are-defined" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>

<p>The D layer can be used as the upper or lower limit, e.g if value &gt; x (probably

negative range or if you want it too not discard on 0 as you want to match 0,
set it to -1 or &gt; 0.1 or &gt; 1. On a high constant rate metric the D layer can be
used to discard if &lt; x so the the layer does not silence a drop.  This layer can
be complimented by the optional D1 layer below. Remember a match here disables

<p>For instance, say occasionally we can expect to see a spike of 404s status codes
on a web app due to bots or your own scanning, with layers we can tell Ionosphere
that a time series was not anomalous if the datapoint is less than 120 and has
values in the last 3 datapoints is less than 5.  This allows for a somewhat
moving window and an alert that would be delayed by say 3 minutes, but it is a
signal, rather than noise. Let us describe that layer as gt_120-5_in_3</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Layers may seem simple, but the layers must be thought about
carefully as it is possible for a metric to have multiple layers created on
multiple features profiles, that could silence any anomalies on the metric.
Specifically D layer, however layer D1 was added to remove this possibility,
if the layers are properly implemented.  The D1 layer is optional (and is
reverse capable with with any existing layers that were created prior to
1.1.3-beta) and is there to let the operator set upper and lower bounds where
necessary.</p>
</div>
<p>Be careful that you do not create another layer later that silences bad, e.g.
dropped to 0, the above example is not a good example of that as we want and
expect 0 on the 404 not found generally, but if it was status code 200, we would
not want any layers silencing a drop to 0, please try and use layer D1 wisely
where required.</p>
<p>However, in this example,  if you want to ensure that your 200 status code count
does not hit 0 or drop off a cliff, you would configure Boundary to watch it.</p>

<p>Ionosphere brings <strong>no</strong> machine learning to Skyline per se.  It is merely making

operator tells it are not anomalous.  Ionosphere is an attempt to give Skyline

<p>If Ionosphere achieves the sentiments expressed in Brian L. Troutwine &#64;bltroutwine

<p>Ionosphere first and foremost was created to give this dimension of human
piloting where necessary.  Giving Skyline that ability to allow human input in
some from to “teach” Skyline what is not anomalous comes with a number
additional benefits, like giving the Skyline the information needed to learn
how to make decisions based on the input data it is provided within.</p>
<p>The initial goal has been achieved, but it comes at a price.  Everything has a
cost and here the cost is the operator needs to

<p>Ionosphere can only be activated by the input from a human neocortex to tell it
what is not anomalous.  Some brain CPU cycles, opening emails and clicks,
assess 1 or 2 more clicks.  It is not easy, however that said it is effective at
what it set out to achieve.</p>

<p>Ionosphere does them better than high rate, highly variable metrics, when it saw

<h2>Ionosphere - autobuild features_profiles dir<a class="headerlink" href="#ionosphere-autobuild-features-profiles-dir" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>

<p>autobuild - TBD at some point in the future, for now see the Backup
section above.</p>
</div>
<p>The number of features_profiles dirs that Ionosphere learn could spawn and the
amount of data storage that would result is unknown. It is possible the operator
is going to need to prune this data a lot of which will probably never be looked
at. Or a Skyline node is going to fail, not have the features_profiles dirs
backed up and all the data is going to be lost or deleted. So it is possible for
Ionosphere to created all the human interrupted resources for the features
profile back under a best effort methodology. Although the original Redis graph
image would not be available, nor the Graphite graphs in the resolution at which
the features profile was created, however the fp_ts is available so the Redis
plot could be remade and all the Graphite graphs could be made as best effort
with whatever resolution is available for that time period.</p>
<p>This allows the operator to delete/prune feature profile dirs by possibly least
matched by age, etc or all and still be able to surface the available features
profile page data on-demand.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>expire features profiles older than?  Ionosphere forget.</p>
