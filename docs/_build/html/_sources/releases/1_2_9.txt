How to update from v1.2.8
-------------------------

- Download the new release tag or clone/update to get it to a temp location,
  ready to be deployed.

.. code-block:: bash

    NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.9-stable-luminosity"    # Your new Skyline version
    OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.8-stable-luminosity"    # Your old Skyline version

    CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH="/opt/skyline/github/skyline"                 # Your Skyline path
    NEW_SKYLINE_PATH="${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"  # Your new Skyline path

    mkdir -p "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH"
    cd "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH"
    git clone https://github.com/earthgecko/skyline .
    git checkout "$NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION"

- Create the new settings.py from your existing settings.py as there are no
  changes between v1.2.8 and v1.2.9.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create the settings.py from your existing settings.py as there are no
    # changes between v1.2.8 and v1.2.9
    cat "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}/skyline/settings.py" > "${NEW_SKYLINE_PATH}/skyline/settings.py"

- Stop Skyline Ionosphere and Panorama services.
- Backup your Skyline database.
- Apply the SQL update to your Skyline database as per described below, change
  the below variables as appropriate to your set up.

.. code-block:: bash

    BACKUP_DIR="/tmp"  # Where you want to backup the DB to
    MYSQL_USER="<YOUR_MYSQL_USER>"
    MYSQL_HOST="127.0.0.1"  # Your MySQL IP
    MYSQL_DB="skyline"  # Your MySQL Skyline DB name

    # Backup DB
    mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
    mysqldump -u$MYSQL_USER -p $MYSQL_DB > $BACKUP_DIR/pre.v1.2.9.$MYSQL_DB.sql

    # Update DB
    mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p $MYSQL_DB < "${NEW_SKYLINE_PATH}/updates/sql/luminosity-v1.2.9-stable.sql

- Stop all the Skyline services and ensure any service controls such as monit,
  supervisor or systemd do not start them again, (change as appropriate for
  your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Stop all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    luminosity
    panorama
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i stop
    done

- Move your current Skyline directory to a backup directory and move the new
  Skyline v1.2.9 with your new settings.py from the temp location to your
  working Skyline directory, (change your paths as appropriate) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH" "/opt/skyline/github/skyline.$OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION"
    mv "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH" "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"

- Start the all Skyline services (change as appropriate for your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="panorama
    luminosity
    horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i start
    done

- Check the logs

.. code-block:: bash

    # How are they running
    tail -n 20 /var/log/skyline/*.log

    # Any errors - each app
    find /var/log/skyline -type f -name "*.log" | while read skyline_logfile
    do
      echo "#####
    # Checking for errors in $skyline_logfile"
      cat "$skyline_logfile" | grep -B2 -A10 -i "error ::\|traceback" | tail -n 60
      echo ""
