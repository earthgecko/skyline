- Make fp_generation_created default to 0 for backwards compatible with older
  features profiles (IssueID #1854: Ionosphere learn - generations)
- Align webapp backend anomaly_count and limit_count
- Support #2072: Make Boundary hipchat alerts show fixed timeframe
- Bug #2050: analyse_derivatives - change in monotonicity
  - Removed unused ionosphere_alerts_returned variable
  - Removed a copy paste last_alert that was not deleted when changed to the last_derivative_metric_key
- Bug fix - if the nonNegativeDerivative has been calculated we need to reset
  the x and y as nonNegativeDerivative has to discard the first value as it
  has no delta and resulted a matplotlib/axes/_base.py error in _xy_from_xy
  `raise ValueError("x and y must have same first dimension")`
  (Bug #2068: Analyzer smtp alert error on Redis plot with derivative metrics)
