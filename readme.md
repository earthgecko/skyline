## Skyline

Skyline is a real time anomaly detection, time series analysis and performance
monitoring system, built to enable passive monitoring on metrics, without the
need to configure a model/thresholds for each one.  It is designed to be used
wherever there are a large quantity of high-resolution time series which need
constant monitoring. Once a metrics stream is set up additional metrics are
automatically added to Skyline for analysis. Skyline's algorithms attempt to
automatically detect what it means for each metric to be anomalous.  Once set up
and running, Skyline allows the user to train it what is not anomalous on a per
metric basis.
