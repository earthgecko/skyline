# This is used to start the python daemon_runner and issue kill to the parent
# process.  Originally a stop call was made to the python daemon_runner which
# initiated a new instance of the agent and the agent's main module, this often
# resulted in the daemon_runner overwritting to the Skyline app log file due to
# complexities in the python logging context relating to log handlers and the
# use of multiprocessing.  These stop calls are no longer made directly to the
# agent and they are made directly to the parent pid.  In terms of the
# python-daemon this is exactly what initiating a new agent does, the
# python-daemon simply issues a os.kill pid, however initiating a new instance
# of the application results in a new daemon_runner that cannot preserve the
# log file object of the running daemon_runner in terms of:
# daemon_context.files_preserve = [handler.stream]
# which results in the log file being overwritten.
